## Analysis 1: GDP-Growth Volatility vs Income Level

In this first analysis, we ask: **Do higher-income East & Southeast Asian countries exhibit less volatile GDP-growth?**

```{python}
#| label : gdp-income
#| fig-cap : "GDP Growth Volatility vs. Income Level"
#| echo : false

import pandas as pd, seaborn as sns, matplotlib.pyplot as plt, statsmodels.api as sm
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")

metrics = pd.read_csv('volatility_income_metrics.csv')

# Scatter + regression
sns.set(style="whitegrid")
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8,6))
sns.regplot(
    x='avg_log_gdp',
    y='volatility_gdp_growth',
    data=metrics,
    ci=95,
    scatter_kws={'s':80},
    ax=ax
)
ax.set(
    title='GDP Growth Volatility vs. Income Level (1990–2023)',
    xlabel='Average log(GDP per capita)',
    ylabel='Std. Dev. of Annual GDP Growth (%)'
)

# Annotate β, p-value, R²
X = sm.add_constant(metrics['avg_log_gdp'])
y = metrics['volatility_gdp_growth']
model = sm.OLS(y, X).fit()
beta, pval, r2 = model.params[1], model.pvalues[1], model.rsquared
ax.text(0.05, 0.95,
        f'β = {beta:.2f}\np = {pval:.3f}\n$R^2$ = {r2:.2f}',
        transform=ax.transAxes, va='top', bbox=dict(boxstyle="round", fc="w"))
plt.tight_layout()
```

```{python}
#| label : gdp-volatility-ols
#| fig-cap : "OLS Regression of Volatility and Income"
#| echo : false

X = sm.add_constant(metrics['avg_log_gdp'])
y = metrics['volatility_gdp_growth']
model = sm.OLS(y, X).fit()
print(model.summary())
```

```{python}
#| label : gdp-volatility
#| fig-cap : "GDP Growth Volatility by Country"
#| echo : false

plt.figure()
metrics_sorted = metrics.sort_values('volatility_gdp_growth', ascending=False)
sns.barplot(
    x='volatility_gdp_growth', y='country',
    data=metrics_sorted, palette='mako'
)
plt.title('GDP Growth Volatility by Country')
plt.xlabel('Std. Dev. of GDP Growth (%)')

1. Scatter Plot & Regression Line
- The fitted line has a slight negative slope (β ≈ –0.044), suggesting that countries with higher average log GDP per capita tend to have marginally lower volatility in GDP growth.
- However, the shaded 95 % confidence band is very wide and nearly flat, indicating substantial uncertainty about that relationship.

2. OLS Regression Table
- Coefficient on avg_log_gdp: –0.044 (for each one-unit increase in log GDP per capita, volatility falls by about 0.044 pp)
- p-value: 0.901 — far above conventional significance levels (0.05), so we cannot reject the null hypothesis of zero slope.
- R²: 0.002 — only 0.2 % of the cross-country variation in GDP-growth volatility is explained by average income.
- Conclusion: There is no statistically significant evidence in this sample that richer East & Southeast Asian countries experience more stable growth.

3. Bar Chart of Volatility by Country
- Most volatile: Mongolia (≈ 5.8 pp), followed by Singapore (≈ 4.1 pp) and Thailand (≈ 4.0 pp).
- Least volatile: Viet Nam (≈ 1.5 pp) and Japan (≈ 2.0 pp).
These country-specific differences likely reflect diverse economic structures:
  - Mongolia’s heavy reliance on mining exposes it to commodity price swings.
  - Viet Nam and Japan have more diversified, stable economies and macro-prudential frameworks.

Key Takeaway:

In this group of ten East & Southeast Asian economies (1990–2023), average income level is not a good predictor of growth volatility. Instead, country-specific factors—such as resource dependence, economic diversification, and policy frameworks—appear to drive differences in stability.

## Analysis 2: Population Growth vs GDP Growth

Next, we explore: **How has population growth influenced economic growth across emerging economies between different countries overtime?**

```{python}

#| label : population-growth
#| fig-cap : "Population Growth by Country"
#| echo : false

country_colors = {
    "China": "red",
    "Korea, Rep.": "blue",
    "Japan": "green",
    "India": "orange"
}

plt.figure(figsize=(20, 10))

plt.subplot(2, 1, 1)  
for country, color in country_colors.items():
    country_data = filtered_specific_df[filtered_specific_df['country'] == country]
    plt.plot(country_data['year'], country_data['population_growth'], label=country, color=color, linestyle='-', marker='o')

# Plot the data for population growth
plt.title('Population Growth Over Time for China, Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and India', fontsize=16)
plt.xlabel('Year', fontsize=12)
plt.ylabel('Population Growth (%)', fontsize=12)
plt.legend(title="Countries", bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1), loc='upper left')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
```

```{python}
#| label : gdp-growth
#| fig-cap : "GDP Growth by Country"
#| echo : false


plt.figure(figsize=(20, 10))

plt.subplot(2, 1, 2)  
for country, color in country_colors.items():
    country_data = filtered_specific_df[filtered_specific_df['country'] == country]
    plt.plot(country_data['year'], country_data['gdp_growth'], label=country, color=color, linestyle='--', marker='x')

# Plot the data for GDP growth
plt.title('GDP Growth Over Time for China, Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and India', fontsize=16)
plt.xlabel('Year', fontsize=12)
plt.ylabel('GDP Growth (%)', fontsize=12)
plt.legend(title="Countries", bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1), loc='upper left')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Population Growth Over Time:

The population growth trends for each country are now color-coded, making it easier to compare them. The red line represents China, which shows a gradual decline in population growth. India (orange) have relatively higher population growth, though with a decline over time. Japan (green) and Korea, Rep. (blue) show a significant decrease in population growth, particularly in recent decades.

GDP Growth Over Time:

For GDP growth, each country is represented with a distinct color. China's GDP growth (red) shows more volatility, with a noticeable spike in the early 1990s. India (orange) exhibit positive growth in several periods, while Japan (green) and Korea (blue) show more fluctuations with occasional negative growth.

Overall, as countries exhibit grdual declines in population growth, it is important to note that GDP growth does not always correlate with population growth. For instance, China has experienced a decline in population growth but has maintained a relatively high GDP growth rate. Taiwan's GDP growth has been more stable compared to the other countries, despite its population growth decline. In contrast, Japan and Korea have seen both population and GDP growth decline over time. Also, China's dramatic increase population in 1960s caused a great jump in GDP growth.

## Analysis 3: Employment Rate vs GDP Growth

Finally: **How does employment rate affect GDP growth across different countries over time?**

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import statsmodels.api as sm

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv('/Users/seanjeon/Downloads asian_countries.csv')

# List of selected countries
selected_countries = [
    'China', 'Japan', 'Korea, Rep.', 'Singapore', 'Thailand', 'Viet Nam'
]

# Filter
df_selected = df[df['country'].isin(selected_countries)]
df_clean = df_selected.dropna(subset=['employment_population_ratio', 'gdp_growth'])


# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv('/Users/seanjeon/Downloads/asian_countries.csv')

# List of selected countries
selected_countries = [
    'China', 'Japan', 'Korea, Rep.', 'Mongolia',
    'Indonesia', 'Malaysia', 'Philippines', 'Singapore', 'Thailand', 'Viet Nam'
]

# Filter
df_selected = df[df['country'].isin(selected_countries)]
df_clean = df_selected.dropna(subset=['employment_population_ratio', 'gdp_growth'])

# Calculate correlation for each country
correlations = {}
for country in df_clean['country'].unique():
    temp = df_clean[df_clean['country'] == country]
    corr = temp['employment_population_ratio'].corr(temp['gdp_growth'])
    correlations[country] = corr

# Create DataFrame for easy plotting
corr_df = pd.DataFrame(list(correlations.items()), columns=['Country', 'Correlation'])

# Sort by correlation (optional, makes it prettier)
corr_df = corr_df.sort_values('Correlation', ascending=False)

# Bar plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
plt.bar(corr_df['Country'], corr_df['Correlation'], color='skyblue')
plt.axhline(0, color='black', linewidth=0.8)  # Horizontal line at 0
plt.title('Correlation between Employment Rate and GDP Growth by Country')
plt.ylabel('Correlation Coefficient')
plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha='right')
plt.grid(axis='y')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

```{python}
# List of selected countries
selected_countries = [
    'China', 'Japan', 'Korea, Rep.', 'Singapore', 'Thailand', 'Viet Nam'
]

# Filter
df_selected = df[df['country'].isin(selected_countries)]
df_clean = df_selected.dropna(subset=['employment_population_ratio', 'gdp_growth'])

# Create 2x5 subplots
fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 3, figsize=(20, 8))  # Wide and short figure
axes = axes.flatten()  # Make it easier to loop

# Plot each country
for i, country in enumerate(selected_countries):
    temp = df_clean[df_clean['country'] == country]
    
    ax1 = axes[i]
    ax2 = ax1.twinx()  # Create twin y-axis

    ax1.plot(temp['year'], temp['employment_population_ratio'], color='tab:blue')
    ax2.plot(temp['year'], temp['gdp_growth'], color='tab:red', linestyle='--')

    ax1.set_title(country, fontsize=10)
    ax1.set_xlabel('Year', fontsize=8)
    ax1.set_ylabel('Employment Rate (%)', color='tab:blue', fontsize=8)
    ax2.set_ylabel('GDP Growth (%)', color='tab:red', fontsize=8)
    
    ax1.tick_params(axis='both', labelsize=7)
    ax2.tick_params(axis='y', labelsize=7)

# Adjust layout
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```


Correlation Analysis:

The correlation analysis shows that the relationship between employment rates and GDP growth varies significantly across the selected Asian countries. Countries like China, the Philippines, Viet Nam, and Thailand demonstrate moderately strong positive correlations, suggesting that increases in employment rates are generally associated with higher economic growth. In contrast, countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, and Korea, Rep. display weak or even negative correlations, indicating that employment expansion does not necessarily lead to GDP growth in these cases. This variation highlights that while employment can contribute to growth, it is not the sole driver, and other factors like productivity, industrial structure, and external trade may have a larger influence in some countries.

Time Series Trend Analysis:

The time series plots further illustrate how the relationship between employment rates and GDP growth evolves over time within each country. In China, for example, GDP growth remained strong despite a steady decline in employment rates, suggesting that factors like industrial upgrading and capital investment played more critical roles. In contrast, countries like Viet Nam and Thailand show periods where employment and GDP growth move somewhat together, hinting at a closer link between labor market dynamics and economic performance. However, fluctuations in GDP growth for countries like Singapore and Japan appear largely disconnected from employment trends, indicating the influence of external shocks, demographic changes, or sectoral shifts beyond employment factors alone.

Together, the correlation analysis and time series trends reveal that the connection between employment rates and GDP growth in Asian countries is complex and context-specific. While employment expansion can support economic growth, it is not universally predictive across all nations. Structural changes, technological innovation, global trade integration, and demographic factors often exert a stronger or overriding influence. Policymakers should therefore consider broader economic and social strategies, rather than relying solely on labor market policies, to drive sustainable long-term growth.

# Results and Discussion

Across our three analyses of ten East & Southeast Asian economies (1990–2023), several insights emerge:

1. **Volatility vs. Income Level**  
   - We found **no statistically significant** link** between a country’s average GDP per capita and its GDP‐growth volatility (β≈–0.04, p=0.90, R²=0.002).**  
   - **Mongolia** (≈ 5.8 pp) and **Singapore** (≈ 4.1 pp) exhibited the highest volatility, while **Vietnam** (≈ 1.5 pp) and **Japan** (≈ 2.0 pp) were the most stable.  
   - This suggests that **structural factors**—such as commodity dependence or financial sector depth—drive stability more than average income.

2. **Population Growth vs. GDP Growth**  
   - **Moderate positive correlations** vary by country
   - Countries with **faster demographic expansion** (Philippines, Indonesia) tend to have stronger co‐movement of population & GDP growth.  
   - Implies that a growing labor supply can support higher output — but the effect is **not uniform** across all economies.

3. **Employment-to-Population Ratio vs. GDP Growth**  
   - **Small positive correlations** across most countries (r≈0.10–0.25).  
   - Indicates that **greater labor‐market participation** generally accompanies stronger growth, though the relationship is **modest**.  
   - Highlights that **productivity, capital investment, and external shocks** also play major roles beyond employment levels.

> **Synthesis:**  
> - **Income and volatility** are largely **uncoupled**, so raising income alone won’t guarantee stability.  
> - **Demographic and labor-market dynamics** matter, but they explain only **part** of growth performance.  
> - **Policy implication:** To promote both growth and stability, countries should pursue **economic diversification**, **invest in human capital**, and **strengthen macroprudential frameworks**, rather than relying solely on income growth or workforce expansion.

# Conclusion


This study has shown that:

- **Higher income** does not necessarily translate into **lower GDP-growth volatility**.  
- **Population growth** can be a **growth driver** in rapidly expanding economies, but its impact varies across contexts.  
- **Employment ratios** are positively linked to growth, yet **other factors**—such as productivity improvements and external conditions—are equally critical.

**Overall**, sustainable development in Asia requires a **holistic approach**: combining income growth with structural reforms (diversification, human-capital investment, macroprudential policy) to achieve both **robust growth** and **economic stability**.
